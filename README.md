## Privacy & Policy Page üìÑ

We have created a dedicated **Privacy Policy** page for Hiru News in order to satisfy Facebook and other platform requirements, and to inform our users how their data is handled.

**URL:**  
[`https://yourusername.github.io/hirunews-privacy/`](https://yourusername.github.io/hirunews-privacy/)  
_or_  
`https://yourusername.github.io/hirunews-privacy/privacy.html`

### What‚Äôs on the page
- What personal data we collect  
- How and why we use the data  
- Data sharing & disclosure  
- Security measures  
- Users‚Äô rights (access, deletion, correction, etc.)  
- How to contact us for privacy concerns  

### How to host it
1. Place an HTML file (e.g. `index.html` or `privacy.html`) with the privacy policy content in your repo.  
2. Enable **GitHub Pages** in your repo settings (select branch / root folder).  
3. Optionally, set up a custom domain or subdomain (e.g. `privacy.hirunews.lk`) pointing to the GitHub Pages site.

### Why we need it
- Facebook (and many platforms) require a **publicly accessible Privacy Policy URL** before allowing apps to go live.  
- It‚Äôs a legal requirement so users know how their data is used.  
- It helps build trust with users by being transparent.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notes / Warnings**  
- The URL must be public and non-editable.  
- If you use a custom domain, that looks more professional (vs just `github.io`).  
- Make sure the content of the policy is accurate and up to date.  
- Some platforms may reject links that point directly to GitHub repositories or markdown files (they want standalone pages).

If you like, I can generate a **README-ready snippet** (with live links) for your specific repo name so you can just paste it in. Do you want me to do that?
